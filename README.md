## Introduction
This repository contains multiple case studies and an exploratory data analysis project, demonstrating my skills in SQL and data manipulation. Each case study focuses on a specific aspect of data analysis, showcasing various SQL techniques for data extraction, transformation, and analysis.

## Case Studies

### Case Study 1: Mobile App Development
- **Objective:** Analyze Play Store data to gain insights into app performance, revenue trends, and user ratings.
- **Key Queries:** 
  - Data cleaning to handle missing values.
  - Revenue analysis based on app categories.
  - Trigger creation for price changes.

### Case Study 2: Laptop Data Analysis
- **Objective:** Analyze laptop specifications and prices to derive insights into market trends and brand performance.
- **Key Queries:** 
  - Price statistics including mean, median, and outlier detection.
  - Categorization of laptops based on price ranges.
  - Analysis of CPU and GPU brands per company.

### Case Study 3: Swiggy Dataset Analysis
- **Objective:** Clean and analyze Swiggy food delivery data to extract meaningful insights regarding food types and restaurant performance.
- **Key Queries:** 
  - Handling null values and data type corrections.
  - Cleaning and categorizing unique food types.
  - Evaluating offer percentages and their impact on ratings.

### Case Study 4: Salary Data Analysis
- **Objective:** Explore salary data to identify trends and opportunities for remote work.
- **Key Queries:** 
  - Analyzing salary growth and disparities.
  - Correlation analysis between experience and salary.
  - Managing employee data access and insights.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
In this section, you will find the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) conducted on a dataset, where I employed various SQL queries to analyze the data's structure, distributions, and relationships between variables. Key findings from the EDA provide insights that inform further analysis and decision-making.

## Data Cleaning
This project includes a comprehensive data cleaning process where I addressed missing values, transformed data types, and standardized data formats in preparation for analysis. The datasets used for cleaning are part of my case studies, and the SQL queries demonstrate the cleaning steps taken to ensure data quality.

## Technologies Used
- SQL
- MySQL
- Jupyter Notebooks (for documentation)
